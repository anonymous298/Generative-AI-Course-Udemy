       "[Document(metadata={'source': '66Y02L2OhEs'}, page_content=\"so you got some tech skills and you want to find freelance projects then this video is for you I'm going to share a complete six-step road map including action items that I would personally follow if I had to start over my freelance career from scratch and no this is not just a how to get started on upwork guide and now I've personally been making a full-time living for the past 5 years as a freelancer working on data and AI projects and during that period I've secured well over half a million dollars worth of freelance contracts and next to that I've also helped dozens of data professionals like you to get started with freelancing to make more money work on fun projects and create Freedom so with that introduction out of the way and a little credibility check mark let's now get into what we're going to cover in this video and I've split it up into three parts so first we're really going to look at the freelancing Paradigm and tackle some common misunderstandings and misconceptions that a lot of people have then we get into the actual road map the six steps that I would personally follow to really start over uh and make it to full-time freelancing and then finally we're going to talk about how I can potentially help you on this journey because we are constantly looking for skilled data professionals to expand our Network so make sure to stick around for that but here's the reality and that is that most of the people watching this video will never find a freelance project and that is not because it's too hard but that is because they're never going to commit and that is okay like I've said freelancing is not for everyone but if you've decided that it is something for you that it is something that you want to try then really my main goal with this video is to at least give you a push and the confidence to go out and try it but now let's get into another common question and that is what skills do I need how good do I need to be in order to get started with freelancing well I started straight out of University so no work experience whatsoever but I did follow an artificial intelligence degree which did gave me the technical skills that I could use for freelancing and now I know that some of you watching might not have a technical degree or still studying or new to working with data and Ai and if you question your current abilities to already take on freelance projects then I would recommend to check out my free community data Alchemy I will leave a link in the description like I said it's completely for free if you follow the courses in there you'll be better prepared way better prepared than I was coming out of University so that should be a good starting point and if you're already a working professional you already have some experience then I would say don't stress too much about it you are probably ready the best way to learn actually is on the job just dive straight in and figure it out later now then on the question of whether you need a degree in a data related field definitely not it can help but I would say certifications with one of the major Cloud platforms like AWS or Azure or the Google Cloud platform are going to help you more than getting a degree because those Cloud certifications will make you certified so AWS certified or Microsoft certified Etc and they will also give you practical skills to not only develop a solution locally a dashboard locally a model locally but also show you how you can actually deploy that in the cloud because in the real world that is where applications end up and something that is not much covered in studies or in University and now finally before diving into the road map let's cover three mistakes that almost everyone's starting out with freelancing mix and the first mistake that people make is they skip the fundamentals and go straight into how do I find clients and admit it you probably fall into that category as well that's probably why you're here you think hey freelancing this is something I want to do but how do I find clients but before you can actually solve the problem of client acquisition the big question right how do I find clients you have to tackle four other problems first and that is exactly what we're going to cover in the road map and now the second mistake that a lot of people make which we already briefly covered is that most people just focus on freelance platforms and this is really hard in the beginning especially without the proper guidance and strategy and this is kind of like a chicken and EG problem where to succeed on a platform you need it you need to build your reputation you need reviews you need to establish your profile and in order to do that you first need projects so you can't get one without the other and the third mistake that a lot of people make is only focusing on small projects and as a result feel like that freelancing is very hard and they can never make a full-time leaving off of it let me explain so usually what happens is people start out with a full-time position and then think hey freelancing this is something I want to try so they naturally start taking on or trying to look for small projects that they can do next to their full-time position so again this is in the mornings this is in the evenings in the weekends as a result you can only take on projects of a certain size and in doing so you are going to likely work with companies who have very small projects for you so these could be projects that you complete in a day maybe a week maybe it takes a month but really if you look at the people that do this full-time and do it successfully they always have a combination of very long-term contracts with companies on a freelance basis but long-term and stack smaller projects on top of that because the last thing that you want to do is Chase from Project to project to project as a result you might have your full-time income and then you make a couple hundred bucks here a couple hundred bucks there and you feel like there's no way I can take this to full-time and that is because you're limited by your full-time position and not focus on strategies to secure those long-term contracts with larger organiz ations where you can work as a freelancer as well so that's a little Nuance in the data and tech industry that I want you to keep in mind let's now actually get into the six-step road map that really I would follow to find freelance projects and step one is really getting clear on your business plan because as a freelancer you're essentially starting a business while a very simple business it is still a business so we need a business plan and this doesn't have to be complicated you really only need to do four four things really to to figure this out so grab a piece of paper or open up a dock and work this out you got to start with a skill what's the core skill that you are that you have right now that you want to help your clients with and I recommend start with one skill later you could potentially extend this to include more skills but start with a high level General skill like data science data analysis data engineering AI engineering machine learning so as you can see here you can just really think about the formal roles job roles in the data and AI industry so this is your starting point all right so once you get clear on that the second thing is we are going to Define your service offering so what can you actually offer as a data scientist what can you offer as a data analyst to help clients with and here you should really think about the the outcomes the deliverables that you can actually help clients with because you're not going to help clients with data science no you're going to help them for example to create a predictive model to solve a particular business problem so here you can really think about creating dashboards creating machine learning models maybe creating chat BS creating data pipelines so these are the surface the service offerings that fall underneath your main skill and here you can have multiple Services especially in the beginning I wouldn't recommend focusing on just one while if that's something you want you can do it but usually under every like core skill there are actually many kind of like sub projects and problems that you can tackle with that core skill so list all of those out so if you're skill and you have your services then we get into subservices and these are essentially the little intermediate steps that you need in order to deliver on the surface so if you for example think about machine learning to deliver a full machine learning project you need to focus on data preparation data cleaning data processing feature engineering training the models evaluating the models maybe creating a dashboard and then also maybe deploying it in the cloud so think of all the various subsurfaces which are essentially little sub problems that you have to solve in order to solve the main problem for the client and list all of those out and really the main reason that we're doing this exercise is to to help you get more clear into brainstorm about what all the things are that you can actually do as a freelancer and help companies with because we don't just go out to say like hey I can do data science for you hey I can do data analytics for you no we got to be a little bit more specific than that and this exercise helps you brainstorm with all of that and also also gives you a bit of confidence to actually see hm you know what there's actually a lot of things that I can do there are a lot of things that I can actually help clients with next to that we are going to do some market research so given all of those services and mainly your core skill you're going to do some research and figure out hey what are current and and goinging Market rates for Freelancers within for example a particular industry within a particular country maybe even within a particular State and also consider your experience level are you beginning or are you a senior with already 20 plus years experience and you can do this by simply doing a Google search with freelance data scientist hourly rate in let's say the Netherlands in the US in Germany whatever just be creative here do some research and figure out what people are actually charging and also what companies are actually willing to pay for a professional with your skills and your experience level all right and then step number two is to start training your entrepreneurial mindset because making the shift from being an employee or from being a student to being a self-employed freelancer and working for clients yes there is definitely a tactical thing and tactical element to that but also there is a huge mental element to that and a lot of people actually never take any action because they just have too many doubts too many questions going on in their head am I good enough is this for me why would anyone hire me and you really have to tackle this headon because really for most people out there this is the biggest bottleneck it's not your technical skills it's just the voice inside your head that's telling you that you are not good enough to do this and if you want to become a successful freelancer and does an entrepreneur you have to work on your mindset and the fact that you are here watching this video instead of already working on some freelance projects I think should be enough evidence for that you're probably trying to figure out that one piece of information that one strategy that one tactic that shows you the way I'm going to show you this road map and that will definitely help but it's you that has to take action and it's you that step out of your comfort zone and actually do something about this to make it change so work on your mindset and now you're probably wondering hey okay Dave this is all cool but how do I actually do this how do I how do I work on my mindset what does that mean well to get you started with this I would recommend a book called psycho cybernetics so getting really into mindset and how you can improve it is really a long journey in a process and really too much to cover in this video but that book is really a good starting point so go check that out all right so now let's get into step number three because we now have a plan and you also understand that it's not only a technical challenge that you have to solve but also really a mental Challenge and the next best thing to focus on is building your personal brand and people usually over complicate this and make it way harder than it actually is they think you need a fancy website a fancy logo and some cool brand colors you don't need all of that to start freelancing the only thing you need is LinkedIn really nowadays your LinkedIn profile is your website it's your funnel that's the way people can connect with you it's where you post content cont and it's how you can get jobs so your next action item is to optimize your LinkedIn profile if you haven't already and if you want to know how to optimize your LinkedIn profile just come to the platform and look at what other people are doing don't copy but just take it as inspiration for example look at my profile and look at everything that I got going on in this profile and just come to the homepage and just look at people that are doing well and getting lots of likes and exposure on the platform go to their profile and see how they are positioning themselves and then after optimizing your profile the next best thing that you can do to build your personal brand is to start posting content on LinkedIn and this is actually a lot less scary than it seems and I would recommend everyone if you're serious about this to commit to posting at least once per week on the LinkedIn platform well then you might be asking well what do I write about this could be anything it doesn't matter it's your personal brand you can Define the strategy you can talk about things you've learned you can talk about projects you've worked on you can talk about things that interest you or you can just talk about personal stories that are going on in your life that's the beauty about building a personal brand and if you want some inspiration just come to my profile make sure to give me a follow so you also stay updated on everything that I post so you can kind of see how I'm building my personal brand on a platform but then just come to posts and just look and browse through all of my uh posts that I created seeing what I talk about how I position myself and the amount of reach uh and engagement that I get with each post and that brings us to step number four which is learning how to effectively sell yourself and your services and this is where people make another common mistake usually where again they focus first on how do I get clients this is what they want they feel like this is their bottleneck that they can't find clients but the reality is finding clients is actually very easy selling yourself to those clients on the other hand is a different story and a lot of technical people actually struggle with that and in order to be good at sales you really need to understand how to package your services how to price your services understand the sales process really understand how you can take a cold lead and stranger really to a highp paying customer and build trust along the way and this really is a skill sales is a skill that you have to learn through studying and then also mainly through practicing and the most important concept to understand here within sales as a freelancer it is that it's never about directly selling your services to the client but rather selling a tailored solution to a problem that the client is experiencing it's never about directly selling data science or AI or even a chatbot it's about selling a solution to a problem and through that chatbot for example can help the company save 20% in Customer Care overhead that is how you want to position yourself in the sales game that is what you want to talk about not about what you can do not about your technical skills not about your degrees it's about what problem is the client dealing with and how can you help them to solve that problem all right and that brings us to step number five which is learning how to consistently find clients so this is the big question right this is probably what you came here for watching this video so you want to know how are other Freelancers doing this how are they finding clients how am I finding my clients what's the secret strategy what's the magic funnel so to get started let's actually look at the data and look at how people in general are getting freelance projects so here's a graph with a title called main information sources used by Freelancers to find work in us so it's from 2020 it has over 6,000 respondents and there's this iction between always freelance and post freelance but that's very similar and here if we look at the data we can really see that at in the top four really the bulk is from either previous clients freelance friends and family social media and professional contacts and if I consider my own situation my business and my journey but also the people that I've helped throughout the years I can definitely confirm these these numbers these top four channels are definitely the most common ways for Freelancers to find projects but now you also see one of the major issues is that actually as a freelancer especially especially in the data and tech industry most of your work and especially for me most of my work just comes from previous clients but then again the question is okay how do I find that initial client base so I can start that Snowball Effect right well I really would recommend friends of family social media and professional context that you already have and now this figure and this strategy it may mainly just tells you where to look right so friends and family social media professional contacts or previous clients if you have them but it doesn't really tell you much about how to go about it right is there's no clear like action plan for you to get started with so probably your best place to to go to is another book uh by Alex Heros called $100 million leads and this really shows you some actionable steps that you can take to find your first paid projects but one thing to note here is that this is a general Business book and while the principles will still apply in any industry the data and tech industry has its own nuances and really the most important aspects to consider here with regards to the data and tech industry is twofold so on the one hand we have this notion of volume where as a freelancer you can do a lot of work with just one client you can make a full-time living with one or two clients you can do that you cannot do that in many other Industries and the second thing to keep in mind is that in the data and tech industry in general projects can get quite complex and a lot of it is custom meaning every time that you start a new project with a client it's a completely unique situation it's a different text Tech maybe a different problem different data and this makes scaling your services with multiple clients challenging so that's something that you have to keep in mind uh but that book is a really good starting point to get you going all right and that brings us to the final step number six and that is learning how to become a true freelance ing professional and what I really mean by this is it's not only about finding the projects right it's not only about finding your clients but it's much more about making sure that you deliver the work that you help the client in such a way that you get repeated work out of it remember the figure I just showed you almost 50% of the Freelancers find new projects through previous clients and the only way that you can do that is if you deliver exceptional services and this is not only about the work that you do it's actually much more about your professional attitude your communication meeting deadlines how you deliver documentation of course your technical skills and what you actually help the client with is important but since you are a freelancer it's about the complete package it's about the total interaction with everything that is you and every interaction that you have with the client contributes towards that experience and this is really something you have to get obsessed with as a freelancer to really make it your mission make it your goal to provide excellent customer services and help your clients to the best of their ability while always maintaining a professional attitude and make sure you always communicate clearly and effectively and now to get started with this I have two more action items for you where the first one is watching a video that's actually already on my YouTube channel which is a snippet from my data freelancer program and it shows you my exact project management philosophy and setup so that's something you can look into and then the second action item is another book called How to Win Friends and Influence People this is an excellent book that will teach you the fundamentals of how to build good relationships with your clients and not just your clients with anyone so I highly recommend that book don't underestimate the importance I know it's pretty cliche right yeah communication is important we all know that but it is so much more important than you think to become a successful freelancer in the long run so that concludes the roadmap and those are really the steps that I would focus on if I had to start over my freelance career from scratch and now if you do decide that you want to take action on this that this is something for you and you commit to following the road map what can you expect what kind of results what kind of progress and to be honest that is mostly going to depend on how much you are willing to step outside of your comfort zone more than your technical skills and if you for example only stick to just using freelance platforms which is really save essentially you're probably going to have a hard time sure eventually you will find a project if you just commit to it but it will probably not be anything lifechanging and now everyone's Journey here is going to be different I've seen plenty of people make it to six figures already after one to two years of starting their freelancing Journey but I also know that this might not be realistic for for everyone but really with persistence and also with the right plan following this road map for example I really believe anyone with data skills can at least make another2 to $3,000 per month if you stick to it and if you commit but just remember that this is a journey and not something that will happen overnight this really takes hard work and now I also know that probably 95% of the people watching this video will after this just continue on with their days and their lives not taking any action not changing anything but if you fall into the 5% if you are an outlier in that sense and you do decide to take action and you do want to do this but want even more help than I've given you already in this video and you really want a proven system where you not only get the road map but also get guidance along the way then data freelancer might be something for you so data freelancer is a 12-month program exclusively for experienced data professionals who want to start or scale a freelancing business to like I've said make more money work on fun projects and create Freedom it's essentially a collection of systems to help you with everything that we've covered in this video and actually a lot more using a proven step-by-step system that you can use to land your first paid projects in as little as 60 days it's a complete Playbook on how we run our business including training resources and templates and everything really that you need to get started with freelancing where really the biggest thing is that you're not doing this alone but doing it with a group of like-minded people who are already playing the game at the level that you want to get to to hold yourself accountable and to motivate you and I will also personally be there to coach you along the way so if that all sounds interesting and you're an experienced data professional with at least one year of working experience and you want to start freelancing but you really want to FASTT track your progress and your your journey here using proven systems and also having expert guidance along the way then you should really check out the first pin comment below this video there you'll find the link to our website with a video where

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'tx5OapbK-8A'}, page_content=\"the whole world is Raging about AI agents right now yet some of the biggest companies like apple and Amazon still struggle to ship effective AI features within their products last week Apple had to pull back Apple intelligence because it was hallucinating in the new summarizations that the product was providing and also Amazon still struggles to put AI features into Amazon Alexa because of the hallucinations yet if you look online on YouTube blog post everyone seems to be building these AI agents and everyone has their own ideas and tools and Frameworks on how to do so but here's the hard truth building effective and reliable AI agents is really hard and most of the examples that you will see online are really cool demos but they are just that they show what's possible they show where the future is going with AI agents but if you really put that into your product and let a lot of people use it it will just simply break down now in this video I want to share some practical tips and techniques for developers to build more effective and reliable ages now while I definitely don't have all the answers here I'm going to share some of the lessons that I've learned over the past 2 years building AI systems for our clients and I'm also going to share insights from some of the leading companies working on these Technologies and now if you're new to the channel my name is Dave abar I'm the founder of data Lumina I hold a bachelor and a master's degree in artificial intelligence and my journey we just started about 10 years ago and for the past 6 years I've been building custom data and AI solutions for my clients and next to that I also run a community with over 100 freelance data nii developers and I make this video to help you level up and become a better engineer so perhaps eventually you might want to join us all right so let's first talk about what AI agents actually are because before we can build them we first need to all be on the same page about what they are right and depending on who you ask you are going to get a very different answer most of the time and that is because a lot of people have different ideas about what they are and if right now you'll search for how to build AI agents online you'll find some tutorials almost all of the tutorials that you'll find where they talk about AI agents what they simply mean is you have some piece of software you have some operations where at some point you're going to make an API call to a large language model but now is it really fair to say that such a system can already be called an AI agent well if you ask the experts the answer is no yet why is then everybody talking about AI agents like they are just dead well that is simply because there is a lot of hype and a lot of Buzz around that particular word everyone wants to learn what AI agents are how to build them but really in the end what they're really after is they want to learn or they want to implement some kind of system that can take some process and automate it they want an automation that's essentially what AI can do for us and right now anytime that topic comes up we say oh it's an AI agent but for this video and for you as a developer I want to dig a little bit deeper and show you some of the different tools and techniques that you can use to what we refer to at dat Lumina as AI systems rather than AI agents where not all AI systems are necessarily AI agents and now to make this more clear for you throughout the rest of this video I want to use a definition or distinction rather as introduced by entropic because this makes total sense to us and this is exactly also how we see the distinction between the different types of AI systems that you can make so so in this excellent blog post called how to build effective agents the under the section what are agents they talk about first how a lot of people have a lot of different ideas about it but then at entropic they make a clear distinction between workflows and agents where workflows quoting are systems where llms and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths so this really aligns with what I was saying previously and what you often find online where you have a certain system some steps some change and at some point you make a call to an llm now agents on the other hand are systems where llms dynamically direct their own processes and Tool usage maintaining control over how they accomplish the task so there's a clear distinction between the two between workflows and agents and as a developer it's crucial to understand when to use which pattern and because of all the tutorials and information out there right now where everyone is using the word agents thinking that you need all kinds of tools and Frameworks in order to build agents there is a lot of confusion if we then come back to entropic's blog post and to the section when and when not to use agents and I in my opinion this really hits the spot so as a developer consider the following when building applications with llms we recommend finding the simplest solution possible something you should always do as an engineer and only increasing complexity when needed this might mean not Building agentic Systems at all and here's the for many applications however optimizing single llm calls with retrieval and in context examples is usually enough and we've been building AI systems for our clients across industry since the day the cat GPT API came out and I can definitely tell you this is true for many applications you don't need these agentic patterns you can build predefined simple workflows that solve a particular problem really well and then create a suite of tests and uations around it to really keep it in control and to really optimize it over time okay so then how do you actually build effective AI agents or rather AI systems I would say so the first step for you as a developer is really deciding on what you are going to use to build your AI system now if you have coding skills you probably want to use something like python or typescript or even JavaScript and if you don't have coding skills you probably want to look at something like make.com n8n or flow wise and it doesn't really matter what tool you use like if you do full coding or use these uh workflow Builders which they are essentially are you in both cases you can build reliable systems it's much more about the underlying patterns that you use to control the flow of your application and your data so that's what I want to dive in right now coming back again to the excellent blog post from entropic where they outline some of the different patterns that you can use to build applications around large language models so here are some of the common building blocks that you can use when building AI systems whether that's workflows or agents and the basic building block that we start with that you all start with is what they call the augmented llm so we start with an llm a simple API call in the beginning and we can augment that we can enhance that by focusing on three things the first one is retrieval then we have tools and then we have memory starting with retrieval this is where your AI system pulls information from a different Source typically a database or a vector database and makes that available within the context of the large language model now in practice typically this is done through retrieval augmented generation or rag for short using a Vector database where you perform a similarity search on people often compare this to giving your llm application long-term memory because you can essentially offload all of the relevant contexts that you need to affect your database and whenever the llm needs it you can try to retrieve it and I'm saying try because with retrieval augmented generation or rag you never truly know what you're going to get back especially as the scale of your uh database grows so the second augmentation of llms is what they call tools and tools are essentially little services or apis that you can call within your application in order to get more information this could be for example making an API call to get the current weather data or to get the latest shipping updates on your parel using the uh trkking number and then the last part here is memory which in this context simply refers to the Past interaction that you've had with the llm system so you can think of this for example when you're talking to cat GPT every time you send or ask something to the model that is then a new record the model will then respond that is a new record and the whole chain the whole sequence of all of those interactions together is what you call the memory so these are the three common Concepts that you'll encounter when you're working with llms and creating these agents in order to make the API call to the llm better this is all about enhancing the context providing more context in order to get better results and when you combine these three and put them together in Perfect Harmony and in sync they take your application Beyond just being a simple open AI or Chad GPT wrapper and really taking your app or automation to the next level just because it can get all of the right context at the right time all right and then up next let's look at a pattern that you can use to build very effective work workflows and often this is all you need and this is called prompt chaining so this is simply just chaining together multiple calls to an llm and typically using the previously generated information and then passing that to the next llm call with in the sequence and in this way you can break down a complex problem and instead of asking the AI write a block post you can break that down to First do some research and get clear on some ideas then dial in on a specific topic then provide an outline of what the um the essay or blog post could look like then give me all of the uh different chapters now write chapter one now write chapter two and every one of those steps could be a a chain within the whole application where at every step you now have more control because at every step there is data and a prompt that you contr control and can tweak and this is guaranteed to improve your application and to make your system smarter overall all right and then let's get into the second pattern routing so while promp chaining can already get you great results if you focus on a single problem if the scope of the problem that you're trying to solve grows bigger and there are multiple scenarios multiple cases multiple solutions that is where routing comes in and what you essentially do with routing is given all the the data and context that is coming in you let the llm decide which way to go and you could clearly instruct the llm for the first step to categorize the incoming requests so is it a or is it B and we then capture that in a structured way so then within our application within our control flow we can use the so-called routers which in theory are practically just if statements or cases where we make a certain match and if output equals a we call that particular function with then which then goes into a particular direction and if the output was B for example we go in a different direction so that is routing and then real quick if you're a developer you got some technical skills and you've been thinking about starting as a freelancer maybe taking on some side projects to make a little bit extra money or learn more but you don't really know where to get started or struggle to land that first client you might want to check out the first link in the description it's a video of me going over how my company can help you with that we have a community with over 100 freelance data nii developers and we're all here to make more money work on fun projects and create Freedom so if that's something you're interested in you might want to check it out all right and the third workflow pattern is paralyzation and with paralyzation you also make similar to a prom chaining you make multiple llm calls but rather than doing doing them sequentially where one output might depend on the other one you do them in parallel and this is ideal for where you can really split up a certain uh certain task break it down but they are independent of each other and this can help you to speed up your application because the output would be the same if you sequence them sequentially but then you need to make multiple API calls and wait for that to finish then do the other one do the other one this is paralyzation is a way to do this async so typical example of this could be when you're implementing guard rails and you want to evaluate a certain output you might have one prompt that valuates accuracy or correctness you might have one prompt that evaluates uh harmfulness and you might have one prompt that is specifically targeted at uh capturing prompt injections so this can all be done in parallel it could then come together and that could act as your guardrail system all right and the next pattern is the orchestrator worker so this is still a workflow pattern but this this already gets a little bit more agentic because it requires a little less explicit programming of steps but it's still sequential and linear in nature and therefore also really predictable so here's an overview of what that looks like visually so another example of how you might want to use this let's take customer care again and an email from uh a customer is coming in and uh you let an llm look at all of the contexts so the customer question you have the CRM data and maybe you also have some some other order data and you have the uh the the customer care guidelines you assess all of that and then ask an llm what's required in order to solve this particular problem and the llm might decide okay we need to look up an assess the right uh section within the customer care Playbook we need to do a look up of the particular order to check the status and we also need to uh call the shipping API in order to get the latest shipping information through this pattern we can make our application already more agentic and have less hardcoded uh Pathways in there all right and then the last workflow pattern is the evaluator Optimizer and this is simply where you let an llm create an output and then feed that into another llm call to review it and give feedback and then pass that to another llm to improve that so you could say write a blog post you have the blog post then you have another prompt that says critically review this blog post and make sure it aderes to XYZ a whole list of things that you would like to have there then give a detailed report of what we can improve the llm will do that you now have a list of feedback points and we feed that back to the llm here's the original output here's the feedback now process all of that all right so that were the workflow patterns but now let's look at what an agent pattern actually looks like and here is that displayed visually where we have a request from a human in this case case we make an llm call that llm is going to decide to take a certain action it's going to check and assess the output of that action within a certain environment so this is mainly just the data that it has access to and the outputs and it's going to provide feedback back to the llm and it does that in a loop until it reaches a certain criteria either uh completing the tasks or a certain stopping criteria or an intermediate step where it's going to ask feedback from a human in the loop so as you can see this is really agentic there is almost no like hardcoded Steps in between just an environment and instructions and tools that an llm can use and it goes off in this Loop and that is one of the key distinctions compared to all of the other patterns that we've described where a workflow has clearly a start point and an end point whereas with a true agent system we don't know all that we know is that we have given it specific instructions to operate within a certain environment to reach a specific goal but if it's going to do that on the first try on the second try on the 100 try or never because it just keeps iterating stock in a loop we don't know yet and with this specific pattern agents can really handle sophisticated tasks but the implementation is often very straightforward we don't have to go to the drawing board and draw out a huge like diagram or workflow we just give it a set of instructions and rules and they are typically just llms using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop and so while these agents in this pattern is actually pretty straightforward to implement getting reliable results from them is really hard and something that is everyone is trying to figure out right now and for most problems again I want to stress this for most problems you don't need a pattern like this and you don't want it you want far more control you want to start really small and work your way up building confidence with within the system and I think the best example of this was was Devin the AI software engineer that got a lot of hype I think already half a year ago and that you can now you can now rent it or buy it as like a junior engineer for your team it's pretty pricey and based on what I've seen so far and people that actually worked with it the results are pretty so out of I saw one example where out of 20 tasks that they would try I think only four or so would work and Deon is a perfect example of a true AI agent where you as a human give it a task you give it a goal let's say code this application or solve this BG and it will go off on itself and it will start to work in loops and it's going to perform unit tests try to run your code try to build see if it runs looks at the errors and then tries to correct those errors over and over again so that's a true agentic system but it doesn't work yet because it's really hard to pull off properly so those are the core patterns that you can use as a developer to build your AI systems and it doesn't really matter which tool or framework or platform you're using whether that's pure python or make.com almost all of these patterns can be implemented and really the key here is to start as simple as possible and build up the complexity over time only when that's necessary and now to conclude this video I want to give you some final tips next to these like core patterns that you should understand that was really the main message of this this video to dive a little bit deeper and understand that understand the differences and now the first one one we already covered but I want to sayate it one more time be very careful with agent Frameworks they can get you up and running really quickly but make sure that you understand everything that's going on and you probably don't need them and it will make you a better engineer if you learn how to build these basic core components from the ground up within your own code base and now the second tip is to to prioritize deterministic workflows over complex agent patterns start really simple and really isolate the problem and build it from the ground off so you first focus on a particular workflow particular problem where you can really optimize that and nail that so it works almost 100% of the time and not 80% of the time and how you can do this look at the problem overall look at all the data that you need to process and as the first step within your system create a categorization step where you essentially only select a very small portion of their problem so let's take the customer care example let's say out of all the tickets that you have first focus on the where's my order question so all the tickets that are coming in you build a router only if the llm decides this is about an order throw it into the AI workflow and solve that all the other tickets just send it to the human agents and this can be extrapolated this idea to almost any problem that you solve take all of the data get categorize it focus on what you want to solve first go vertical on that then scale horizontal to other problems as well once you understand the full scope of the problem you can start to think about introducing more agentic patterns but you first need to understand how you as a human would break it down step by step before you can instruct an AI to do so and then tip number three is don't underestimate what happens when you scale your application going from the demo to hey it works here is cool to now we're going to put this in front of hundreds or potentially thousands or millions of users is such a big difference and that chaos that we were talking about if you like scale chaos that is is just going to get insane and you will have hallucination so just don't underestimate that it's really hard so scaling rag is also really hard if you have your Factor database and you increasingly add more and more and more data that's also going to be a challenge on its own so be very careful with scaling your application and putting it in front of a lot of users too soon otherwise you'll end up with something that apple had with apple intelligence and the only way to do this systematically and properly is to have a proper testing and evaluation system in place which is tip number four start with this from the beginning don't neglect it a lot of people simply like don't know how to do this um and that's why they don't have it in place again ask yourself the question if you were to change your system prompt right now could you say for sure that it's going to improve your application Beyond just a f check this is something that you have to keep in mind if the answer is no you should look into that and figure out what it means for your application to set something up like this okay so the next one is to put proper guard rails within your application and this is actually really simple to do but a lot of people just skip this step and it's really a quick win so make sure before sending your data or the output back to the customer to the application you have at least another llm do a quick check on whether we can actually send this and while it may sound very straightforward this is something that for example a company like Amazon didn't manage to put in one of their customer support chat Bots where if you would ask it whether it was an AI or a human it would Clearly say no this is a human you're talking to and it would even give you a name but then someone tried to ask the customer support to give a code function back so within that same trat first the said yes I'm human and it was like can you explain me how to build XYZ function in Python and it would give just the whole explanation and write out all the codes and this is just like so embarrassing and even the biggest companies out there right now um fail to do this properly so really put those guard rails in place and perform various checks in order to protect your brand and to protect your reputation all right and then the final optional tip that I want to give you the other ones weren't optional this is optional is if you want to learn more about how we at data Lum structure our projects and build these AI systems all the way from how we structure our code within the repository to the infrastructure and deployments that we use then you can check out the link in the description to our generative AI Launchpad we wrapped this into a product and made it available in a giup repository where this is essentially our entire company's IP that we worked on in the last two years and we make that available for AI Engineers who want to learn how to build and deploy generative AI apps and now this is a paid product just want to be transparent here but if you're serious about AI engineering and you want to speed up your learning join our community and get in our Discord with myself and the other engineers at data Luma to ask questions then you might want to check it out all right and that's it for this video now thank you very much for watching if you found it helpful please leave a like and consider subscribing and then next up I recommend to check out this video where I go over 17 python libraries that we use for our AI engineering projects\")]"
