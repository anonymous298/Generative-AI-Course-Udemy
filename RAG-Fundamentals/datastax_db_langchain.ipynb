       "[Document(metadata={'source': '66Y02L2OhEs'}, page_content=\"so you got some tech skills and you want to find freelance projects then this video is for you I'm going to share a complete six-step road map including action items that I would personally follow if I had to start over my freelance career from scratch and no this is not just a how to get started on upwork guide and now I've personally been making a full-time living for the past 5 years as a freelancer working on data and AI projects and during that period I've secured well over half a million dollars worth of freelance contracts and next to that I've also helped dozens of data professionals like you to get started with freelancing to make more money work on fun projects and create Freedom so with that introduction out of the way and a little credibility check mark let's now get into what we're going to cover in this video and I've split it up into three parts so first we're really going to look at the freelancing Paradigm and tackle some common misunderstandings and misconceptions that a lot of people have then we get into the actual road map the six steps that I would personally follow to really start over uh and make it to full-time freelancing and then finally we're going to talk about how I can potentially help you on this journey because we are constantly looking for skilled data professionals to expand our Network so make sure to stick around for that but here's the reality and that is that most of the people watching this video will never find a freelance project and that is not because it's too hard but that is because they're never going to commit and that is okay like I've said freelancing is not for everyone but if you've decided that it is something for you that it is something that you want to try then really my main goal with this video is to at least give you a push and the confidence to go out and try it but now let's get into another common question and that is what skills do I need how good do I need to be in order to get started with freelancing well I started straight out of University so no work experience whatsoever but I did follow an artificial intelligence degree which did gave me the technical skills that I could use for freelancing and now I know that some of you watching might not have a technical degree or still studying or new to working with data and Ai and if you question your current abilities to already take on freelance projects then I would recommend to check out my free community data Alchemy I will leave a link in the description like I said it's completely for free if you follow the courses in there you'll be better prepared way better prepared than I was coming out of University so that should be a good starting point and if you're already a working professional you already have some experience then I would say don't stress too much about it you are probably ready the best way to learn actually is on the job just dive straight in and figure it out later now then on the question of whether you need a degree in a data related field definitely not it can help but I would say certifications with one of the major Cloud platforms like AWS or Azure or the Google Cloud platform are going to help you more than getting a degree because those Cloud certifications will make you certified so AWS certified or Microsoft certified Etc and they will also give you practical skills to not only develop a solution locally a dashboard locally a model locally but also show you how you can actually deploy that in the cloud because in the real world that is where applications end up and something that is not much covered in studies or in University and now finally before diving into the road map let's cover three mistakes that almost everyone's starting out with freelancing mix and the first mistake that people make is they skip the fundamentals and go straight into how do I find clients and admit it you probably fall into that category as well that's probably why you're here you think hey freelancing this is something I want to do but how do I find clients but before you can actually solve the problem of client acquisition the big question right how do I find clients you have to tackle four other problems first and that is exactly what we're going to cover in the road map and now the second mistake that a lot of people make which we already briefly covered is that most people just focus on freelance platforms and this is really hard in the beginning especially without the proper guidance and strategy and this is kind of like a chicken and EG problem where to succeed on a platform you need it you need to build your reputation you need reviews you need to establish your profile and in order to do that you first need projects so you can't get one without the other and the third mistake that a lot of people make is only focusing on small projects and as a result feel like that freelancing is very hard and they can never make a full-time leaving off of it let me explain so usually what happens is people start out with a full-time position and then think hey freelancing this is something I want to try so they naturally start taking on or trying to look for small projects that they can do next to their full-time position so again this is in the mornings this is in the evenings in the weekends as a result you can only take on projects of a certain size and in doing so you are going to likely work with companies who have very small projects for you so these could be projects that you complete in a day maybe a week maybe it takes a month but really if you look at the people that do this full-time and do it successfully they always have a combination of very long-term contracts with companies on a freelance basis but long-term and stack smaller projects on top of that because the last thing that you want to do is Chase from Project to project to project as a result you might have your full-time income and then you make a couple hundred bucks here a couple hundred bucks there and you feel like there's no way I can take this to full-time and that is because you're limited by your full-time position and not focus on strategies to secure those long-term contracts with larger organiz ations where you can work as a freelancer as well so that's a little Nuance in the data and tech industry that I want you to keep in mind let's now actually get into the six-step road map that really I would follow to find freelance projects and step one is really getting clear on your business plan because as a freelancer you're essentially starting a business while a very simple business it is still a business so we need a business plan and this doesn't have to be complicated you really only need to do four four things really to to figure this out so grab a piece of paper or open up a dock and work this out you got to start with a skill what's the core skill that you are that you have right now that you want to help your clients with and I recommend start with one skill later you could potentially extend this to include more skills but start with a high level General skill like data science data analysis data engineering AI engineering machine learning so as you can see here you can just really think about the formal roles job roles in the data and AI industry so this is your starting point all right so once you get clear on that the second thing is we are going to Define your service offering so what can you actually offer as a data scientist what can you offer as a data analyst to help clients with and here you should really think about the the outcomes the deliverables that you can actually help clients with because you're not going to help clients with data science no you're going to help them for example to create a predictive model to solve a particular business problem so here you can really think about creating dashboards creating machine learning models maybe creating chat BS creating data pipelines so these are the surface the service offerings that fall underneath your main skill and here you can have multiple Services especially in the beginning I wouldn't recommend focusing on just one while if that's something you want you can do it but usually under every like core skill there are actually many kind of like sub projects and problems that you can tackle with that core skill so list all of those out so if you're skill and you have your services then we get into subservices and these are essentially the little intermediate steps that you need in order to deliver on the surface so if you for example think about machine learning to deliver a full machine learning project you need to focus on data preparation data cleaning data processing feature engineering training the models evaluating the models maybe creating a dashboard and then also maybe deploying it in the cloud so think of all the various subsurfaces which are essentially little sub problems that you have to solve in order to solve the main problem for the client and list all of those out and really the main reason that we're doing this exercise is to to help you get more clear into brainstorm about what all the things are that you can actually do as a freelancer and help companies with because we don't just go out to say like hey I can do data science for you hey I can do data analytics for you no we got to be a little bit more specific than that and this exercise helps you brainstorm with all of that and also also gives you a bit of confidence to actually see hm you know what there's actually a lot of things that I can do there are a lot of things that I can actually help clients with next to that we are going to do some market research so given all of those services and mainly your core skill you're going to do some research and figure out hey what are current and and goinging Market rates for Freelancers within for example a particular industry within a particular country maybe even within a particular State and also consider your experience level are you beginning or are you a senior with already 20 plus years experience and you can do this by simply doing a Google search with freelance data scientist hourly rate in let's say the Netherlands in the US in Germany whatever just be creative here do some research and figure out what people are actually charging and also what companies are actually willing to pay for a professional with your skills and your experience level all right and then step number two is to start training your entrepreneurial mindset because making the shift from being an employee or from being a student to being a self-employed freelancer and working for clients yes there is definitely a tactical thing and tactical element to that but also there is a huge mental element to that and a lot of people actually never take any action because they just have too many doubts too many questions going on in their head am I good enough is this for me why would anyone hire me and you really have to tackle this headon because really for most people out there this is the biggest bottleneck it's not your technical skills it's just the voice inside your head that's telling you that you are not good enough to do this and if you want to become a successful freelancer and does an entrepreneur you have to work on your mindset and the fact that you are here watching this video instead of already working on some freelance projects I think should be enough evidence for that you're probably trying to figure out that one piece of information that one strategy that one tactic that shows you the way I'm going to show you this road map and that will definitely help but it's you that has to take action and it's you that step out of your comfort zone and actually do something about this to make it change so work on your mindset and now you're probably wondering hey okay Dave this is all cool but how do I actually do this how do I how do I work on my mindset what does that mean well to get you started with this I would recommend a book called psycho cybernetics so getting really into mindset and how you can improve it is really a long journey in a process and really too much to cover in this video but that book is really a good starting point so go check that out all right so now let's get into step number three because we now have a plan and you also understand that it's not only a technical challenge that you have to solve but also really a mental Challenge and the next best thing to focus on is building your personal brand and people usually over complicate this and make it way harder than it actually is they think you need a fancy website a fancy logo and some cool brand colors you don't need all of that to start freelancing the only thing you need is LinkedIn really nowadays your LinkedIn profile is your website it's your funnel that's the way people can connect with you it's where you post content cont and it's how you can get jobs so your next action item is to optimize your LinkedIn profile if you haven't already and if you want to know how to optimize your LinkedIn profile just come to the platform and look at what other people are doing don't copy but just take it as inspiration for example look at my profile and look at everything that I got going on in this profile and just come to the homepage and just look at people that are doing well and getting lots of likes and exposure on the platform go to their profile and see how they are positioning themselves and then after optimizing your profile the next best thing that you can do to build your personal brand is to start posting content on LinkedIn and this is actually a lot less scary than it seems and I would recommend everyone if you're serious about this to commit to posting at least once per week on the LinkedIn platform well then you might be asking well what do I write about this could be anything it doesn't matter it's your personal brand you can Define the strategy you can talk about things you've learned you can talk about projects you've worked on you can talk about things that interest you or you can just talk about personal stories that are going on in your life that's the beauty about building a personal brand and if you want some inspiration just come to my profile make sure to give me a follow so you also stay updated on everything that I post so you can kind of see how I'm building my personal brand on a platform but then just come to posts and just look and browse through all of my uh posts that I created seeing what I talk about how I position myself and the amount of reach uh and engagement that I get with each post and that brings us to step number four which is learning how to effectively sell yourself and your services and this is where people make another common mistake usually where again they focus first on how do I get clients this is what they want they feel like this is their bottleneck that they can't find clients but the reality is finding clients is actually very easy selling yourself to those clients on the other hand is a different story and a lot of technical people actually struggle with that and in order to be good at sales you really need to understand how to package your services how to price your services understand the sales process really understand how you can take a cold lead and stranger really to a highp paying customer and build trust along the way and this really is a skill sales is a skill that you have to learn through studying and then also mainly through practicing and the most important concept to understand here within sales as a freelancer it is that it's never about directly selling your services to the client but rather selling a tailored solution to a problem that the client is experiencing it's never about directly selling data science or AI or even a chatbot it's about selling a solution to a problem and through that chatbot for example can help the company save 20% in Customer Care overhead that is how you want to position yourself in the sales game that is what you want to talk about not about what you can do not about your technical skills not about your degrees it's about what problem is the client dealing with and how can you help them to solve that problem all right and that brings us to step number five which is learning how to consistently find clients so this is the big question right this is probably what you came here for watching this video so you want to know how are other Freelancers doing this how are they finding clients how am I finding my clients what's the secret strategy what's the magic funnel so to get started let's actually look at the data and look at how people in general are getting freelance projects so here's a graph with a title called main information sources used by Freelancers to find work in us so it's from 2020 it has over 6,000 respondents and there's this iction between always freelance and post freelance but that's very similar and here if we look at the data we can really see that at in the top four really the bulk is from either previous clients freelance friends and family social media and professional contacts and if I consider my own situation my business and my journey but also the people that I've helped throughout the years I can definitely confirm these these numbers these top four channels are definitely the most common ways for Freelancers to find projects but now you also see one of the major issues is that actually as a freelancer especially especially in the data and tech industry most of your work and especially for me most of my work just comes from previous clients but then again the question is okay how do I find that initial client base so I can start that Snowball Effect right well I really would recommend friends of family social media and professional context that you already have and now this figure and this strategy it may mainly just tells you where to look right so friends and family social media professional contacts or previous clients if you have them but it doesn't really tell you much about how to go about it right is there's no clear like action plan for you to get started with so probably your best place to to go to is another book uh by Alex Heros called $100 million leads and this really shows you some actionable steps that you can take to find your first paid projects but one thing to note here is that this is a general Business book and while the principles will still apply in any industry the data and tech industry has its own nuances and really the most important aspects to consider here with regards to the data and tech industry is twofold so on the one hand we have this notion of volume where as a freelancer you can do a lot of work with just one client you can make a full-time living with one or two clients you can do that you cannot do that in many other Industries and the second thing to keep in mind is that in the data and tech industry in general projects can get quite complex and a lot of it is custom meaning every time that you start a new project with a client it's a completely unique situation it's a different text Tech maybe a different problem different data and this makes scaling your services with multiple clients challenging so that's something that you have to keep in mind uh but that book is a really good starting point to get you going all right and that brings us to the final step number six and that is learning how to become a true freelance ing professional and what I really mean by this is it's not only about finding the projects right it's not only about finding your clients but it's much more about making sure that you deliver the work that you help the client in such a way that you get repeated work out of it remember the figure I just showed you almost 50% of the Freelancers find new projects through previous clients and the only way that you can do that is if you deliver exceptional services and this is not only about the work that you do it's actually much more about your professional attitude your communication meeting deadlines how you deliver documentation of course your technical skills and what you actually help the client with is important but since you are a freelancer it's about the complete package it's about the total interaction with everything that is you and every interaction that you have with the client contributes towards that experience and this is really something you have to get obsessed with as a freelancer to really make it your mission make it your goal to provide excellent customer services and help your clients to the best of their ability while always maintaining a professional attitude and make sure you always communicate clearly and effectively and now to get started with this I have two more action items for you where the first one is watching a video that's actually already on my YouTube channel which is a snippet from my data freelancer program and it shows you my exact project management philosophy and setup so that's something you can look into and then the second action item is another book called How to Win Friends and Influence People this is an excellent book that will teach you the fundamentals of how to build good relationships with your clients and not just your clients with anyone so I highly recommend that book don't underestimate the importance I know it's pretty cliche right yeah communication is important we all know that but it is so much more important than you think to become a successful freelancer in the long run so that concludes the roadmap and those are really the steps that I would focus on if I had to start over my freelance career from scratch and now if you do decide that you want to take action on this that this is something for you and you commit to following the road map what can you expect what kind of results what kind of progress and to be honest that is mostly going to depend on how much you are willing to step outside of your comfort zone more than your technical skills and if you for example only stick to just using freelance platforms which is really save essentially you're probably going to have a hard time sure eventually you will find a project if you just commit to it but it will probably not be anything lifechanging and now everyone's Journey here is going to be different I've seen plenty of people make it to six figures already after one to two years of starting their freelancing Journey but I also know that this might not be realistic for for everyone but really with persistence and also with the right plan following this road map for example I really believe anyone with data skills can at least make another2 to $3,000 per month if you stick to it and if you commit but just remember that this is a journey and not something that will happen overnight this really takes hard work and now I also know that probably 95% of the people watching this video will after this just continue on with their days and their lives not taking any action not changing anything but if you fall into the 5% if you are an outlier in that sense and you do decide to take action and you do want to do this but want even more help than I've given you already in this video and you really want a proven system where you not only get the road map but also get guidance along the way then data freelancer might be something for you so data freelancer is a 12-month program exclusively for experienced data professionals who want to start or scale a freelancing business to like I've said make more money work on fun projects and create Freedom it's essentially a collection of systems to help you with everything that we've covered in this video and actually a lot more using a proven step-by-step system that you can use to land your first paid projects in as little as 60 days it's a complete Playbook on how we run our business including training resources and templates and everything really that you need to get started with freelancing where really the biggest thing is that you're not doing this alone but doing it with a group of like-minded people who are already playing the game at the level that you want to get to to hold yourself accountable and to motivate you and I will also personally be there to coach you along the way so if that all sounds interesting and you're an experienced data professional with at least one year of working experience and you want to start freelancing but you really want to FASTT track your progress and your your journey here using proven systems and also having expert guidance along the way then you should really check out the first pin comment below this video there you'll find the link to our website with a video where
