Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6 Results\\n6.1 Machine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

They use the advanced natural language processing techniques of large language models (LLMs) to comprehend and respond to user inputs step-by-step and determine when to call on external tools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        How AI agents work\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAt the core of AI agents are\\xa0large language models\\xa0(LLMs). For this reason, AI agents are often referred to as LLM agents.\\xa0Traditional\\xa0LLMs, such as\\xa0IBM®\\xa0Granite™ models,\\xa0produce their responses based on the data used to train them and are bounded by knowledge and reasoning limitations. In contrast, agentic technology uses tool calling on the backend to obtain up-to-date information, optimize workflow and create subtasks autonomously to achieve complex goals.\\nIn this process, the autonomous agent learns to adapt to user expectations over time. The agent\\'s ability to store past interactions in memory and plan future actions encourages a personalized experience and comprehensive responses.1\\xa0This tool calling can be achieved without human intervention and broadens the possibilities for real-world applications of these AI systems.\\xa0The approach that\\xa0AI agents\\xa0take in achieving goals set by users is comprised of these three stages:\\n\\n\\nGoal initialization and planning\\n\\n\\nAlthough\\xa0AI agents\\xa0are autonomous in their\\xa0decision-making\\xa0processes, they require goals and environments defined by humans.2\\xa0There are three main influences on\\xa0autonomous agent\\xa0behavior:\\xa0\\nThe team of developers that design and train the agentic\\xa0AI system.\\xa0The team that deploys the agent and provides the user with access to it.The user that provides the\\xa0AI agent\\xa0with specific goals to accomplish and establishes available tools to use.\\nGiven the user\\'s goals and the agent’s available tools, the\\xa0AI agent\\xa0then performs task decomposition to improve performance.3\\xa0Essentially, the agent creates a plan of\\xa0specific tasks\\xa0and subtasks to accomplish the complex goal. \\nFor simple tasks, planning is not a necessary step. Instead, an agent can iteratively reflect on its responses and improve them without planning its next steps.\\n\\n\\nReasoning using available tools\\n\\n\\nAI agents base their actions on the information they perceive. Often,\\xa0AI agents\\xa0do not have the full\\xa0knowledge base needed\\xa0for tackling all subtasks within a complex goal. To remedy this,\\xa0AI agents use their available tools. These tools can include external\\xa0data sets, web searches,\\xa0APIs and even other agents. After the missing information is retrieved from these tools, the agent can update its knowledge base. This means that each step of the way, the agent reassesses its plan of action and self-corrects.\\nTo help illustrate this process, imagine a user planning their vacation. The user tasks an AI agent with predicting which week in the next year would likely have the best weather for their surfing trip in Greece. Since the LLM model at the core of the agent does not specialize in weather patterns, the agent gathers information from an external database comprised of daily weather reports for Greece over the past several years.\\nDespite acquiring this new information, the agent still cannot determine the optimal weather conditions for surfing and so, the next subtask is created. For this subtask, the agent communicates with an external agent that specializes in surfing. Let’s say that in doing so, the agent learns that high tides and sunny weather with little to no rain provide the best surfing conditions.\\nThe agent can now combine the information it has learned from its tools to identify patterns. It can predict which week next year in Greece will likely have high tides, sunny weather and a low chance of rain. These findings are then presented to the user. This sharing of information between tools is what allows\\xa0AI agents\\xa0to be more general-purpose than traditional\\xa0AI models.3\\n\\n\\nLearning and reflection\\n\\n\\nAI agents\\xa0use feedback mechanisms, such as other AI agents and human-in-the-loop (HITL), to improve the accuracy of their responses. Let’s return to our previous surfing example to highlight this. After the agent forms its response to the user, the agent stores the learned information along with the user’s feedback to improve performance and adjust to user preferences for future goals.\\nIf other agents were used to reach the goal, their feedback may also be used.\\xa0Multi-agent feedback can be especially useful in minimizing the time that human users spend providing direction. However, users can also provide feedback throughout the agent\\'s actions and internal reasoning to better align the results with the intended goal.2\\nFeedback mechanisms improve the\\xa0AI agent\\'s reasoning and accuracy, which is commonly referred to as iterative refinement.3\\xa0To avoid repeating the same mistakes,\\xa0AI agents\\xa0can also store data about solutions to previous obstacles in a\\xa0knowledge base.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustry newsletter\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\\n\\n\\nThank you!

Several paradigms exist for solving multi-step problems.\\n\\n\\nReAct (Reasoning and Action)\\n\\n\\nWith this paradigm, we can instruct agents to \"think\" and plan after each action taken and with each tool response to decide which tool to use next. These Think-Act-Observe loops are used to solve problems step by step and iteratively improve upon responses.\\nThrough the prompt structure, agents can be instructed to reason slowly and to display each \"thought\".4\\xa0The agent\\'s verbal reasoning gives insight into how responses are formulated. In this framework, agents continuously update their context with new reasoning. This can be interpreted as a form of\\xa0Chain-of-Thought prompting.\\n\\n\\nReWOO (Reasoning WithOut Observation)\\n\\n\\nThe ReWOO method, unlike ReAct, eliminates the dependence on tool outputs for action planning. Instead, agents plan upfront. Redundant tool usage is avoided by anticipating which tools to use upon receiving the initial prompt from the user. This is desirable from a human-centered perspective since the user can confirm the plan before it is executed.\\nThe ReWOO workflow is made up of three modules. In the planning module, the agent anticipates its next steps given a user\\'s prompt. The next stage entails collecting the outputs produced by calling these tools. Lastly, the agent pairs the initial plan with the tool outputs to formulate a response. This planning ahead can greatly reduce token usage and computational complexity as well as the repercussions of intermediate tool failure.5\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        Types of AI agents\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAI agents can be developed to have varying levels of capabilities. A simple agent may be preferred for straightforward goals to limit unnecessary computational complexity. In order of simplest to most advanced, there are 5 main agent types:\\n\\n\\n1. Simple reflex agents\\n\\n\\nSimple reflex agents are the simplest agent form that grounds actions on current\\xa0perception. This agent does not hold any memory, nor does it interact with other agents if it is missing information. These\\xa0agents function\\xa0on a set of so-called reflexes or rules. This means that the agent is preprogrammed to perform actions that correspond to certain conditions being met.\\nIf the agent encounters a situation that it is not prepared for, it cannot respond appropriately. The agents are only effective in environments that are fully observable granting access to all necessary information.6\\nExample: A thermostat that turns on the heating system at a set time every night. The condition-action rule here is, for instance, if it is 8 PM, then the heating is activated.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Model-based reflex agents\\n\\n\\nModel-based reflex agents use both their current\\xa0perception\\xa0and memory to maintain an internal model of the world. As the agent continues to receive new information, the model is updated. The agent’s actions depend on its model, reflexes, previous\\xa0precepts and current state.\\nThese agents, unlike\\xa0simple reflex agents, can store information in memory and can operate in environments that are partially observable and changing. However, they are still limited by their set of rules.6\\nExample: A robot vacuum cleaner. As it cleans a dirty room, it senses obstacles such as furniture and adjusts around them. The robot also stores a model of the areas it has already cleaned to not get stuck in a loop of repeated cleaning.\\n\\n\\n3. Goal-based agents\\n\\n\\nGoal-based agents have an internal model of the world and also a goal or set of goals. These agents search for action sequences that reach their goal and plan these actions before acting on them. This search and planning improve their effectiveness when compared to simple and\\xa0model-based reflex agents.7\\nExample: A navigation system that recommends the fastest route to your destination. The model considers various routes that reach your destination, or in other words, your goal. In this example, the agent’s condition-action rule states that if a quicker route is found, the agent recommends that one instead.\\n\\n\\n4. Utility-based agents\\n\\n\\nUtility-based agents select the sequence of actions that reach the goal and also maximize utility or reward. Utility is calculated using a utility function. This function assigns a utility value, a metric measuring the usefulness of an action or how “happy” it will make the agent, to each scenario based on a set of fixed criteria.\\nThe criteria can include factors such as progression toward the goal, time requirements, or computational complexity. The agent then selects the actions that maximize the expected utility. Hence, these agents are useful in cases where multiple scenarios achieve a desired goal and an optimal one must be selected.7\\nExample: A navigation system that recommends the route to your destination that optimizes fuel efficiency and minimizes the time spent in traffic and the cost of tolls. This agent measures utility through this set of criteria to select the most favorable route.\\n\\n\\n5. Learning agents\\n\\n\\nLearning agents hold the same capabilities as the other agent types but are unique in their ability to learn. New experiences are added to their initial\\xa0knowledge base, which occurs autonomously. This learning enhances the agent’s ability to operate in unfamiliar environments.\\xa0Learning agents\\xa0may be utility or goal-based in their reasoning and are comprised of four main elements:7\\nLearning:\\xa0This\\xa0improves the agent’s knowledge by learning from the environment through its\\xa0precepts\\xa0and sensors.Critic:\\xa0This\\xa0provides feedback to the agent on whether the quality of its responses meets the performance standard.Performance:\\xa0This element is responsible for selecting actions upon learning.Problem\\xa0generator:\\xa0This\\xa0creates various proposals for actions to be taken.\\nExample: Personalized recommendations on e-commerce sites. These agents track user activity and preferences in their memory. This information is used to recommend certain products and services to the user. The cycle repeats each time new recommendations are made. The user’s activity is continuously stored for learning purposes.

From treatment planning for patients in the emergency department to managing drug processes, these systems save the time and effort of medical professionals for more urgent tasks.9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Emergency response\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\nIn case of natural disasters,\\xa0AI agents\\xa0can use\\xa0deep learning\\xa0algorithms\\xa0to retrieve the information of users on social media sites that need rescue. The locations of these users can be mapped to assist rescue services in saving more people in less time. Therefore,\\xa0AI agents\\xa0can greatly benefit human life in both mundane tasks and life-saving situations.10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        Benefits of AI agents\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nTask automation\\n\\n\\nWith the ongoing\\xa0advancements\\xa0in\\xa0generative AI, there is a growing interest in workflow\\xa0optimization using AI, or intelligent automation.\\xa0AI agents\\xa0are\\xa0AI tools\\xa0that can\\xa0automate\\xa0complex tasks\\xa0that would otherwise require human resources. This translates to goals being reached inexpensively, rapidly and at scale. In turn, these\\xa0advancements\\xa0mean\\xa0human agents\\xa0do not need to provide direction to the\\xa0AI assistant\\xa0for creating and navigating its tasks.\\n\\n\\nGreater performance\\n\\n\\nMulti-agent\\xa0frameworks\\xa0tend to outperform singular agents.11\\xa0This is because the more plans of action are available to an agent, the more learning and reflection occur. An AI agent incorporating knowledge and feedback from other\\xa0AI agents\\xa0specializing in related areas can be useful for information synthesis. This\\xa0backend\\xa0collaboration of AI agents and the ability to fill information gaps are unique to agentic frameworks, making them a powerful tool and a meaningful advancement in artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\nQuality of responses\\n\\n\\nAI agents\\xa0provide responses that are more comprehensive, accurate and personalized to the user than traditional\\xa0AI models. This is extremely important to us as users since higher-quality responses typically yield a better customer experience. As previously described, this is made possible through exchanging information with other agents, using external tools and updating their memory stream. These behaviors emerge on their own and are not preprogrammed.12\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        Risks and limitations\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nMulti-agent dependencies\\n\\n\\nCertain complex tasks require the knowledge of multiple AI agents. When implementing these multi-agent frameworks, there is a risk of malfunction. Multi-agent systems built on the same\\xa0foundation models\\xa0may experience shared pitfalls. Such weaknesses could cause a system-wide failure of all involved agents or expose vulnerability to adverse attacks.13\\xa0This highlights the importance of data governance in building foundation models and thorough training and testing processes.\\n\\n\\nInfinite feedback loops\\n\\n\\nThe convenience of the hands-off\\xa0reasoning for human users using\\xa0AI agents\\xa0also comes with its risks. Agents that are unable to create a comprehensive plan or reflect on their findings, may find themselves repeatedly calling the same tools, invoking infinite feedback loops. To avoid these redundancies, some level of\\xa0real-time\\xa0human monitoring may be used.13\\n\\n\\nComputational complexity\\n\\n\\nBuilding\\xa0AI agents\\xa0from scratch is both time-consuming and can also be very computationally expensive. The resources required for training a high-performance agent can be extensive. Additionally, depending on the complexity of the task, agents can take several days to complete tasks.12\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        Best practices\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nActivity logs\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTo address the concerns of multi-agent dependencies, developers can provide users with access to a log of agent actions.14\\xa0The actions can include the use of external tools and describe the external agents utilized to reach the goal. This transparency grants users insight into the iterative\\xa0decision-making\\xa0process, provides the opportunity to\\xa0discover\\xa0errors and builds trust.\\n\\n\\nInterruption\\n\\n\\nPreventing\\xa0AI agents\\xa0from running for overly long periods of time is recommended. Particularly, in cases of unintended infinite feedback loops, changes in access to certain tools, or malfunctioning due to design flaws. One way to accomplish this is by implementing interruptibility.\\nMaintaining control of this involves allowing human users the option to gracefully interrupt a sequence of actions or the entire operation. Choosing if and when to interrupt an\\xa0AI agent\\xa0requires some thoughtfulness as some terminations can cause more harm than good. For instance, it may be safer to allow a faulty agent to continue assisting in a life-threatening emergency than to completely shut it down.5\\n\\n\\nUnique agent identifiers\\n\\n\\nTo mitigate the risk of agentic systems being used for malicious use, unique identifiers can be used.14\\xa0If these identifiers were to be required for agents to access external systems, there would be greater ease in tracing the origin of the agent\\'s developers, deployers and its user. This would be particularly helpful in case of any malicious use or unintended harm done by the agent. This level of accountability would provide a safer environment for these\\xa0AI agents\\xa0to operate.\\n\\n\\nHuman supervision\\n\\n\\nTo assist in the learning process for\\xa0AI agents, especially in their early stages in a new environment, it can be helpful to provide occasional human feedback. This allows the\\xa0AI agent\\xa0to compare its performance to the expected standard and adjust accordingly. This form of feedback is helpful in improving the agent’s adaptability to user preferences.5\\nApart from this, it is best practice to require human approval before an\\xa0AI agent\\xa0takes highly impactful actions. For instance, actions ranging from sending mass emails to financial trading should require human confirmation.7\\xa0Some level of human monitoring is recommended for such high-risk domains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Ebook\\n        \\n\\n            How to choose the right foundation model\\n        \\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\\n\\nRead the ebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Report\\n        \\n\\n            AI in Action 2024\\n        \\nWe surveyed 2,000 organizations about their AI initiatives to discover what\\'s working, what\\'s not and how you can get ahead.\\n\\nRead the report\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            AI models\\n        \\n\\n            Explore IBM Granite\\n        \\nIBM® Granite™ is our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automations has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet\\'s automaton created in the early 1800s. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic artificial intelligence ===\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Artificial Intelligence research began in the 1950s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) and the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI. Since the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\\n\\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning used both discriminative models and generative models, to model and '),\n",

Unlike traditional pornography, which involves real actors and cameras, this content is synthesized entirely by AI algorithms. These algorithms, including Generative adversarial network (GANs) and text-to-image models, generate lifelike images, videos, or animations from textual descriptions or datasets.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe use of generative AI in the adult industry began in the late 2010s, initially focusing on AI-generated art, music, and visual content. This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated NCII (AI Undress) ===\\nSeveral US states are taking actions against using deepfake apps and sharing them on the internet. In 2024, San Francisco filed a landmark lawsuit to shut down \"undress\" apps that allow users to generate non-consensual AI nude images, citing violations of state laws. The case aligns with California\\'s recent legislation—SB 926, SB 942, and SB 981—championed by Senators Aisha Wahab and Josh Becker and sig')]"
