This form of feedback is helpful in improving the agent’s adaptability to user preferences.5\\nApart from this, it is best practice to require human approval before an\\xa0AI agent\\xa0takes highly impactful actions. For instance, actions ranging from sending mass emails to financial trading should require human confirmation.7\\xa0Some level of human monitoring is recommended for such high-risk domains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Ebook\\n        \\n\\n            How to choose the right foundation model\\n        \\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\\n\\nRead the ebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Resources'),\n",
